# CRISPR Guide RNA Design Environment

An AI agent benchmark that simulates the workflow of a computational biologist designing CRISPR gene edits — the same process used in real gene therapy research.

> CRISPR won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This environment turns that science into a fully deterministic RL training benchmark.

---

## Overview

The agent receives a DNA sequence containing a known pathogenic mutation. It must identify valid cut sites, design a guide RNA, and assess whether the edit is safe — mirroring exactly what biologists do in the lab before a clinical trial.

Three tasks of increasing difficulty:

| Task | What the agent does | Max Score |
|------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Easy** | Find all NGG PAM sites (valid cut anchors) in a 90-bp sequence | 1.0 |
| **Medium** | Design a 20-nt guide RNA near a mutation + score on-target efficiency | 1.0 |
| **Hard** | Check off-target binding risk for 3 candidate guides, rank them, pick the safest | 1.0 |

All scoring is **fully deterministic** — PAM sites are rule-based (NGG), efficiency uses Doench Rule Set 2 formulas, off-targets use mismatch counting with seed-region checks. No LLM-as-judge.

## Available Actions

```
scan_sequence(pam_positions)      →  submit found NGG PAM sites
design_guide(position)            →  get 20-nt guide RNA at a PAM position
score_ontarget(guide)             →  Doench RS2 efficiency score [0–1]
check_offtarget(guide_index)      →  off-target hit count in genome excerpt
select_best(ranking, selected)    →  final safety ranking + recommendation
```

---

## Reward Structure

### Easy — PAM Scanning
```
reward = correct_found / total_true_pams   (recall, max 1.0)
```

### Medium — Guide Design
```
reward = 0.4 (valid guide near mutation) + 0.6 × efficiency_score
```

### Hard — Safety Assessment
```
reward = 0.3 (all 3 guides checked)
       + 0.4 (correct safety ranking)
       + 0.3 (correct guide selected)
```

## Biology Background

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **PAM site** | NGG motif where Cas9 anchors before cutting |
| **Guide RNA (gRNA)** | 20-nt sequence that directs Cas9 to the target |
| **On-target efficiency** | How reliably the guide cuts at the intended site |
| **Off-target binding** | Accidental cuts at similar sequences elsewhere in the genome |
| **Doench Rule Set 2** | Published scoring model for gRNA efficiency (Nature Biotech 2016) |
